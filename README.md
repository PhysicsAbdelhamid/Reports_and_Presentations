This file contain some of my projects done in class (Original LaTex file -when available- and presentation), under the supervision of my professors which I thanks greatly. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question and/or suggestion when regarding theses works, I will be happy to help ;)

# Remarks

1. Unfortunately, some of my cited works in my CV have been lost, or I am not able to found them.
2. For all of them, we was having a number of pages limitation, thus I plan to make a review of some of them in my homepage, especially on the "Notion of Universality" and maybe others if I have enoughcourage to do so ;) 
3. Don't hesitate to contact me concerning the needed codes for the "Measure of galaxy mass", I could give you a hint in the coding part :)
